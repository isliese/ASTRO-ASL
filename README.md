# 👽 ASTRO ASL

## 📝 Summary  
**ASTRO ASL (American Sign Language)** is an AI-powered sign language transcriber designed specifically for space missions. By capturing and interpreting ASL gestures in real time, ASTRO ASL bridges communication gaps in environments where traditional audio communication fails.

## 🎯 Mission Statement  
Our mission is to empower astronauts with a reliable, silent communication tool.  
We strive to:  
- Enable non-verbal communication in space where sound doesn't travel  
- Support inclusivity for deaf or hard-of-hearing astronauts  
- Enhance safety through clear, real-time gesture recognition  

By combining cutting-edge AI with intuitive design, ASTRO ASL provides a seamless way for astronauts to interact without relying on sound — ensuring mission-critical information is never lost in translation.

## ⚠️ The Problem  
Sound doesn’t travel in the vacuum of space, making traditional spoken communication unreliable during spacewalks or in loud environments.  
- Verbal communication is limited in spacewalks  
- Audio equipment can malfunction or be blocked by suits  
- Safety risks increase when commands aren't clearly heard  

> **ASTRO ASL provides a hands-on solution to a soundless environment.**
